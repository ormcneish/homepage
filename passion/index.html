        <h2>Iced Lattes</h2>
    
        <h3>My favorite beverage on planet earth is an iced latte.</h3>
        <h4>I simply would not be able to function without them.</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Iced lattes are so good because they’re refreshing and energizing at the same time; cold, creamy, and just caffeinated enough to wake you up without feeling heavy. Plus, you can customize them endlessly with different milks, syrups, and flavors, so they always fit your mood, whether you’re feeling classic, sweet, or a little adventurous </p>
        <br>
        <p class="thick">Some examples of flavors I like are:</p>

        <h4>The perfect coffee-to-ice ratio</h4>
        <p>For an iced latte that doesn’t taste watered down, a great rule of thumb is about 1 part ice to 1–1.5 parts liquid coffee/milk combined.<br>
        More specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fill the glass about halfway to two-thirds with ice</li>
            <li>Pour 1–2 shots of espresso (or strong brewed coffee) over the ice</li>
            <li>Add milk to the top</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key is using strong coffee and enough ice to keep it cold without melting instantly—too little ice melts fast and dilutes everything, but too much ice leaves you with a sad, milky sip. Balance = peak iced latte vibes</p>
        <h4>The perfect espresso to milk ratio</h4>
        <p>For a classic, perfectly balanced latte, the sweet spot is about 1 part espresso to 3–4 parts milk.<br>That usually looks like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1–2 shots of espresso</li>
            <li>6–8 oz of milk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ratio lets the espresso flavor shine without overpowering the drink, while the milk adds creaminess and just enough sweetness. Want it bolder? Use less milk. Want it smoother and more mellow? Add a splash more milk. Latte perfection is all about dialing it to your taste</p>
